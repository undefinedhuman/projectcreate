# NAMING CONVENTIONS
name every new variable you want as new metadata pluginname-variablename // For plugins only so no event naming collisions occur
basic metadata that can be used with other events?
 -> entityIDs
 -> playerIDs
 -> itemIDs
 -> etc.

Store available user ids in different table?
GET ALL WORLD NAMES?
GET ALL PLAYER NAMES?
