# Metadata Container

{
    serverID/IP: 168.0.1.67,
    time_frame: 4.4.2022:16.17.23, 4.4.2022:16:22:23, // MAXIMUM OF 5 MINUTES? OR 5000 EVENTS
    metadata: {
        eventClasses: [ BlockBreakEvent, PlayerJoinEvent, PlayerQuitEvent ]     // UUID1 BlockBreakEvent
        playerIDs: [ "UUID1", "UUID2", "UUID3" ]
        blockIDs: [ 1, 2, 67, 34, 90 ]
        area: { min: { 0, 10 }, max: { 10, 90 } }
        worldNames: [ "main" ]
    },
    dataID: "UUID of Data Collection, which contains all the events in one huge JSON"
}



# NAMING CONVENTIONS
name every new variable you want as new metadata pluginname-variablename // For plugins only so no event naming collisions occur
basic metadata that can be used with other events?
 -> entityIDs
 -> playerIDs
 -> itemIDs
 -> etc.

Reserved Names:
 -> entityIDs
 -> playerIDs
 -> itemIDs
 --> Maybe add restrictions in the plugin for those names so they only can be strings etc.

Store available user ids in different table?
GET ALL WORLD NAMES?
GET ALL PLAYER NAMES?

Maybe init Metadata with default container -> so if no container class is defined maybe get the type from the field and just create a BasicMetadataContainer (Set Metadata container) and create that instance

ERROR MESSAGES FOR WHEN Metadata Container Type Doesnt match the field type

THE METADATA SHOULD CONTAIN THE SERVER ID/IP? LATER ON

SAVING TO TEXT FILE IF THERE ARE EVENT BUCKETS IN THE QUEUE

Maybe refactor metadata bucket the static things are kinda ugly ngl

maybe thing about doing for everything else then the reserved metadata keys (entityI, playerID) a PLUGIN_NAME.KEY so e.g. kamino: KAMINO.position or e.g. projectcreate PROJECTCREATE.position
