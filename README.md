> SE_06 All relevant code is in the kamino & kamino-api directories, most of the database code is in kamino/src/de/undefinedhuman/projectcreate/kamino/database/Couchbase.java

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java JDK Version 17
* Gradle 7.4 (wrapper files already included in the repository)
* Additional java dependencies can be found in the root [build.gradle](https://gitlab.playprojectcreate.com/undefinedhuman/project-create/-/blob/main/build.gradle) file

## Prerequisites

Create a personal access token (GitLab, scope: api) to allow gradle to download dependencies from the project's private package repository.
[Gitlab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/#authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token-in-gradle)

> IMPORTANT! Insert the token into your local global gradle directory located in the home folder and never commit it to the repository!

## Installation
Required dependencies are automatically downloaded by Gradle. 

```sh
# Clone repository
git clone https://gitlab.playprojectcreate.com/undefinedhuman/project-create.git
cd project-create/
```

### Usage
```sh
# Run either part of the project except the server by replacing "SUB_PROJECT_NAME" with either "game", "editor", "updater" or "launcher" to launch the specific sub project
./gradlew :SUB_PROJECT_NAME:run
```

### Server Usage
It is recommended for running a local development server to use arguments that place the server directory in the home folder instead of in the repository.

```sh
# The server will create the folder containing configs/logs/etc. with path ~/.projectcreate/server and set the log level to debug
./gradlew :SUB_PROJECT_NAME:run --args='".projectcreate/server" "External" "debug"'
```

### Plugin Installation (Kamino)
Plugin installation can be done by placing the plugin jar file in the plugin folder of the server.

Example: 
Server directory: ~/.projectcreate/server \
Plugin: [Kamino](https://gitlab.playprojectcreate.com/undefinedhuman/project-create/-/package_files/309/download) (kamino.jar)

Place the jar file (kamino.jar) in ~/.projectcreate/server/plugins/kamino.jar, and run the server as usual.
